This is difftest_ng, "Difftest, the next generation".

Difftest is a program/framework helping to find errors in image
compression algorithms. It allows to measure many error measures
between a reference image and a compressed and re-expanded
image. Error measures are targetted not at human vision, but at
measures that allow to automatically detect common problems in image
codecs.

In addition, difftest_ng includes a couple of convenience functions,
including restricting the measurement only to a single component,
computing the FFT (or weighted FFT), filtering the image, measuring
the histogram and converting between various image formats. Currently,
difftest_ng supports pnm (ppm,pgm,pbm), pgx (JPEG 2000 reference
testing format), bmp, TIFF, multiple of raw formats with very flexible
specifications, pfm, rgbe, png, exr and dpx.

difftest_ng compiles under GNU/Linux and probably some other operating
systems, it requires libpng, libgsl and libopenexr for its full
function. Without additional libraries, some of its operations are not
available.

Source and destination image formats are recognized by the file name extension. While this
is certainly not the most elegant method to identify image formats, it has been proven to
be robust enough for the purpose of difftest_ng.

The following file name extensions are currently recognized:

.pnm,.pgm,.ppm,.pbm,.pfm,.pfs:	   File formats from the pnm (Picture Any Map) format
				   The precise format does not depend on the extender, but
				   on the number of components and whether the data is float
				   or integer. pnm is the superset, pgm is grey scale, ppm
				   RGB, pbm binary data. While all the above represent
				   integer samples, pfs and pfm are floating point sample
				   formats.

.bmp:				   The Windows(tm) native bitmap format, covering 4 and 8
				   bits per sample, palette or true-color images of various
				   bitdepths.

.pgx:				   The file format defined by ISO/IEC 15444-4 (JPEG 2000)
				   used there for conformance testing. pgx can represent any
				   integer type of samples. A pgx file consists of a directory
				   file - the one with the .pgx ending that is specified, and
				   header and data files. The header files define the
				   dimensions and bitdepths of the data files. Data and header
				   may be concatenated together, difftest_ng understands this
				   case, but always writes separate headers as output.

.tif,.tiff			   The Tagged Image File Format, originally specified by
				   Adobe. TIFF supports multiple formats, including YUV sub-
				   sampling, palette files and floating-point formats.

.png				   PNG is a simple lossless image compression scheme for
				   internet images and replaced there gif images. This
				   requires libpng available.

.rgbe,.hdr			   RGBE high-dynamic range images. While rgbe and hdr are
				   not exactly identical, they are close enough to be
				   supported as sub-formats of the same format. When
				   creating files, RGBE is created.

.dpx				   The DPX format specified by SMTPE, used mainly to
				   represent frame-based movie content. dpx can represent
				   integer and floating point samples of various bit-depths,
				   including YUV data and subsampling. Unfortunately,
				   the format is quite underspecified and not all software
				   seems to follow the specs (or an interpretation thereof)
				   precisely.

.exr				   The openEXR format by Industrial Light & Magic, a
				   format for representing high-dynamic range images. This
				   requires libopenexr to be available.

.raw,.craw,.v210		   Raw formats. All raw formats are covered by a single
				   format converter that requires the specification of the
				   layout of the format as part of the file name. Use the
				   --rawhelp command line option how to specify a raw
				   format.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raw formats are unframed and hence the formatting of the file must be specified
on the command line, here as part of the FILE NAME, not by separate options.

Raw files are specified by 'filename.raw@format', with an '@' (at) sign separating
the format specification from the file name. Note that the annex .raw is necessary.

The format specification itself consists of two parts, the image dimensions and
the layout of the data:

<width>x<height>x<depth>:<datalayout>

where <width> is the width, <height> the height and <depth> the number of
components in the image, without the angle brackets (pure numerical values).
Numbers are separated by 'x' (lower-case x).
This part MAY be omitted for saving since image dimensions are known.
The colon ':', however, must be present.

Image data can be either represented INTERLEAVED, that is, all components of a
single pixel are adjacent to each other, or SEPARATE, that is, each component is
described in a separate bitplane, and the bitplanes are stored adjacent to each
other. Additional padding bits might be present in the interleaved representation.
A single pixel is described by one or several fields, where each field encodes
the data of a single component or may simply be present for padding.
Fields can be either signed or unsigned, have a bit-width and an endianness.

In the interleaved presentation, fields can be bit-packed together, i.e. may share
bits in a byte, word or longword. If fields are bit-packed, the entire number of
bits must be either 8,16 or 32, and shares the endianness of all its components,
i.e. all components must indicate the same endianness.

In the separate presentation, bits of a component are packed near each other
without any padding. However, some components might be subsampled, i.e. may
contain less samples than others. This option does not exist for interleaved
data.

The format specification looks like this for interleaved data:

<packing>{<sign-flag><bits><endian>=<target>}:{<sign-flag><bits><endian>=<target>}:...

where <packing> is either + or -, indicating the packing order within the field
      with +, which is the default, packing is from MSB to LSB, with '-' bits
      are packed from LSB to MSB
where the curly brackets indicate the interleaved format
where <sign-flag> is an optional '+' or '-' sign indicating whether the component
      is signed (then '-') or unsigned (then '+'). If omitted, the component is
      unsigned.
where <bits> is a mandatory number of bits the component takes, e.g. 8
where <endian> is an optional endian indicator. It is '+' for big-endian and '-'
      for little-endian data. If omitted, big-endian is assumed.
where <target> indicates to which component the data belongs, e.g. 0 for red
      the target is separated by an equals sign '=' from the endianness.
      For padding data, equal-sign and target are omitted.
where the colon ':' indicates that fields have separate endianness. This only
      works for fields of withs 8,16,32 or 64 bits.

If the colon is replaced by a comma, the fields adjacent to the comma are bit-
packed into a single data unit. In total, up to 32 bits can be packed together,
and the total number of bits packed must be either 8, 16 or 32. Then, the endian-
ness of all fields packed together applies to the packed result, and must be
identical. By default, bit-packing reads from the MSB to the LSB. With the
optional minus sign in front, packing is from LSB to MSB.
Components may appear multiple times in the same format specification, which implies
subsampling. The subsampling factors are inclined from the sample count per component.
The sample pattern is filled at each line end, potentially creating dummy samples that
will be skipped over when reading and which are written as zero on writing.

The format for the separate representation uses square brackets instead:

<packing>[<sign-flag><bits><endian>=<target>]/<subx>x<suby>:...

and the syntax is as above, except that subsampling factors can be added to a field
description. They are separated by a slash '/' from the field description, followed
by the horizontal and vertical subsampling factors, separated by an 'x'.

EXAMPLES:

A 640x480 RGB image with 8 bits per component encoded as RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBB
is denoted as this:

       image.raw@640x480x3:{8=0}:{8=1}:{8=2}

Image dimensions can be omitted when saving, it then may be simplified to:

      image.raw@:{8=0}:{8=1}:{8=2}

Note both '@' and ':' must be present.


Typical image formats:

{8=2}:{8=1}:{8=0}:           24 bits, pixel layout:
                             BBBBBBBBGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR
{8=2}:{8=1}:{8=0}:{8}        32 bits, plus a pad byte:
                             BBBBBBBBGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR00000000
{8=2}:{8=1}:{8=0}:{8=3}      32 bits plus alpha channel:
                             BBBBBBBBGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAA
[1=0]                        bit-packed 1bpp black & white image
[8=0]:[8=1]:[8=2]            YUV or RGB in separate encoding, three planes, each 8bpp
[8=0]:[8=1]/2x2:[8=2]/2x2    YUV 420 in separate planes
[8=0]:[8=1]/2x1:[8=2]/2x1    YUV 422 in separate planes
{2-},{10-=2},{10-=1},{10-=0} 32 bits, pixel layout is ten bits per component with
                             two padding bits in front, packed into 32 bits which
                             is written in little-endian format. Represented as
                             little endian, this format reads
                             00BBBBBBBBBBGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRR
                             but in the file, bytes are shuffled around:
                             RRRRRRRR GGGGGGRR BBBBGGGG 00BBBBBB
{1-},{5-=2},{5-=1},{5-=0}    16 bits, pixel layout is five bits per component with
                             a single pad-bit upfront, packed into a 16-bit word
                             which is written in little-endian format. On a little
                             endian machine, this reads as
                             0BBBBBGGGGGRRRRR
                             but in the file, bytes are ordered reversely:
                             GGGRRRRR 0BBBBBGG
-{10-=1},{10-=0},{10-=2},{2-}:-{10-=0},{10-=1},{10-=0},{2-}:
-{10-=2},{10-=0},{10-=1},{2-}:-{10-=0},{10-=2},{10-=0},{2-}
                             This (single) line creates a raw format that complies to the
                             V210 pixel format. Each component is 10 bits wide,
                             three samples are left-aligned into one 32 bit word
                             causing two padding bits per 32 bit word. Each 32 bit
                             word is in little endian, and filled from LSB to MSB.
                             The samping order is UYV - YUY - VYU - YVY.
                             Subsampling factors are derived from the sample counts
                             and padding is applied at the end of each line to one
                             complete cycle.
